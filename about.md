My name is Lutsai Alexander. I'm from Russia.

In this blog I will write about my projects and other interesting and usefull things.

From early childhood I'm interested with electrotechnics and programming.

Now I've got experience with program languages:

- C# - 6 years
- Python - 2.5 years
- C++ - 1 year


Also I've been using AVR microcontrollers in many my projects. And now I'm learning with STM32 MCs.

I'm using Fedora as my OS, i3wm as WM and Emacs as my editor, IDE, music player, FM and etc.
